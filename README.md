| <details><summary><b>**Ingredients:**</b></summary> <br> 1. Mathematical equations of various types (linear, quadratic, trigonometric, etc.) <br> 2. Knowledge of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, etc.) <br> 3. Problem-solving skills <br> 4. Patience </details> | <details><summary><b>**Description:**</b></summary> <br> **Tiles: A Music Composer** is an interactive grid-based tool for composing music. Each tile in the grid represents a note in a synthesized sequence. When activated, these tiles play musical notes in a loop, allowing users to create complex rhythms and melodies by arranging and activating tiles. <br> <b>Features:</b> <br> 1. **Grid Layout:** The interface consists of a grid where each cell represents a musical note. The size and layout of the grid can vary depending on the composition tool. <br> 2. **Synthesized Notes:** Each tile corresponds to a specific synthesized note, and the pitch and duration of the note can usually be customized. <br> 3. **Looping:** Notes played by the tiles are looped to create continuous sound sequences. Users can set the loop length and the timing for each tile. <br> 4. **Activation and Deactivation:** Tiles can be activated or deactivated to include or exclude notes from the loop. This enables dynamic composition and real-time changes to the music. <br> 5. **Customizable Parameters:** Users can often adjust parameters such as volume, pitch, and effects to modify the synthesized sound for each note. </details> | <details><summary><b>**Description:**</b></summary> <br> **Activities: Online Learning Index** is a curated resource designed to help learners navigate various online educational tools and platforms.
