## Template for Learning about Security and Templates

A template for building templates

---

## Introduction

This template is designed to help users understand the basics of template creation and the best practices for incorporating security into template design.

## Security Best Practices

- Ensure that all user inputs are sanitized.
- Use HTTPS for all connections.
- Implement access controls to restrict who can view or edit the template.
- Regularly update dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities.

## Common Security Pitfalls

- Hardcoding sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
- Failing to validate user inputs, which can lead to injection attacks.
- Overlooking the principle of least privilege when assigning roles.

## Key Concepts

- **Template Inheritance**: How templates can be built upon each other to create a hierarchy, reducing redundancy.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A type of security vulnerability that can occur if user input is improperly handled.

## Example Scenario

When creating a form template that collects user data, ensure that all input fields are validated to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Hands-On Exercise

1. Create a basic HTML template that includes a form for user registration.
2. Implement input validation to ensure that all fields are correctly filled out.
3. Identify potential security risks in your template and modify the code to mitigate these risks.

## Example Code Snippet

```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
    
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
    
    <input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>
```
