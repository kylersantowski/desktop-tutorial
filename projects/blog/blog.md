> ## [The hype about HTML][#HTML]

[**Hypertext Markup Language**][#HTML], commonly reffered to as [HTML][#HTML] is the backbone of web development. It is the building block that structures and defines the content of a webpage, giving it both form and function. Without [HTML][#HTML], the web as we know it would simply not exist

- [HTML][#HTML] is a markup language that uses tags to define elements within a webpage. These tags provide instructions to the browser on how to display the content. By using a combination of opening and closing tags, you can create headings, paragraphs, images, links, and much more. [HTML][#HTML] tags give structure to your content, making it organized and easily readable by both humans and search engines

- The importance of [HTML][#HTML] cannot be understated. It is the foundation upon which websites and applications are built. Just as a strong and well-constructed foundation is crucial for the stability of a building, [HTML][#HTML] provides the structural integrity for your digital creations. It allows you to arrange and present your content in a logical and hierarchical manner, ensuring a seamless user experience

- [HTML][#HTML] is not only essential for organizing and presenting content, but it also plays a vital role in search engine optimization (SEO). By using semantic [HTML][#HTML] tags, you can provide meaningful information to search engines about the structure and context of your content. This helps search engines understand and index your website more accurately, ultimately improving its visibility in search results

- In addition, [HTML][#HTML] is the language that enables accessibility on the web.

Together with [HTML][#HTML], [CSS][#CSS] forms the bedrock of web design, allowing you to create captivating and engaging user experiences***

---

> ## [The CSS craze][#CSS]

[CSS][#CSS], which stands for [**Cascading Style Sheet**][#CSS], is a language used to define the visual appearance of a webpage. It enables you to specify how elements should be displayed on the screen, from the size and color of text to the positioning and spacing of images and other content. By using [CSS][#CSS], you can create consistency across your website, ensuring that each page reflects your desired aesthetic and maintains a cohesive visual identity

- One of the key advantages of [CSS][#CSS] is its ability to separate design from content. Rather than cluttering your [HTML][#HTML] code with inline styles, which can be time-consuming to manage and update, [CSS][#CSS] allows you to create a separate stylesheet that controls the visual aspects of your website. This not only makes your code cleaner and more organized but also makes it easier to make global design changes across your entire site

- In addition to its convenience and efficiency, [CSS][#CSS] also offers a wide range of styling options. You can choose from an extensive set of properties and values to customize the appearance of your elements. Whether you want to adjust font properties, create complex layouts with grids and flexboxes, or add animations and transitions to bring your website to life, [CSS][#CSS] provides the necessary tools to make your vision a reality

- Moreover, [CSS][#CSS] is compatible with responsive design, allowing you to optimize your website for different screen sizes and devices. By utilizing media queries, you can tailor the layout and styling of your webpages to ensure they look great on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. This flexibility is essential in today's mobile-driven world, where users expect a seamless and engaging experience regardless of the device they are using

> ## [SVG Graph][#SVGGraph]

Scalable Vector Graphics are a vector-based image format for the web, defined in XML format. Every element and attribute in SVG files can be animated. SVG is a W3C recommendation and integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL.

SVG images are composed of points and lines instead of pixels, which means they can be scaled to any resolution without affecting quality. SVG images can also be animated and include multiple layers.

You can create SVG images with any text editor, but it is often more convenient to create SVG images with a drawing program, like Inkscape. There are also online platforms where you can find free SVG vectors and icons, and tools like Canva's SVG Editor that allow you to edit your SVG images online

- SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor
- SVG images can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed
- SVG images are scalable
- SVG images can be printed with high quality at any resolution
- SVG images are zoomable
- SVG graphics do NOT lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized
- SVG is an open standard
- SVG files are pure XML

## Introduction

I'd would like to share with you the story of how our non-profit charity organization came to be.

[***our brand***][#heartofstone] was established in 2008 by a small, dedicated group of friends who wanted to make a significant difference in their lives.

Inspired by the idea of using art as a tool for social change, and they decided to create a clothing line that would support various causes and charities.

[***Our name***][#heartofstone] comes from the idea that we can be strong and resilient in the face of adversity, but also compassionate and caring towards others.

[***Our logo***][#heartofstone] is a heart-shaped stone that symbolizes our values and mission.

[***our products***][#heartofstone] are sourced from organic, recycled materials enabling us to donate more profits to different organizations that work on issues such as environmental protection, human rights, animal welfare, education, health, and more.

[***Our goal***][#heartofstone] is to create clothing that is not only stylish and comfortable, but also meaningful and impactful. We want to empower our customers to express themselves and their passions through their outfits, and to inspire them to join us in making the world a better place.

We hope you enjoyed learning more about our history and vision. If you want to support us and our causes, you can visit our website [***heartofstoneclothing.com***][#heartofstone] and browse our collections, contribute towards our non-profit fundraising events, or shop our well resourced products.

We also partner with local artisans and communities to create unique and ethical designs that reflect their cultures and traditions. You can also follow us on social media and join our community of like-minded people.

Thank you for reading and ***stay tuned*** for *regular* **updates** and ***exciting promotions*** from the heart-of-it-all. Any donations would be greatly appreciated.
Here is a link to my [🤢][#heartofstone], a description of the outcome, and a description of our presence.

> ## [**Data Visualisation**][data-visualisation-certificate]

Is the process of transforming data into graphical or pictorial forms that can reveal patterns, trends, and insights. Data visualisation can help us understand complex information more easily and communicate it more effectively. Data visualisation can be used for various purposes, such as:

## Explore, Analyze, Communicate, and Present Data

- Exploring and analysing data to discover new insights and generate hypotheses.
- Communicating and presenting data to inform, persuade, or educate an audience.
- Monitoring and evaluating data to track progress, performance, or outcomes.

Data visualisation can take many forms, such as charts, graphs, maps, dashboards, infographics, and interactive displays. The choice of the appropriate form depends on the type, size, and structure of the data, as well as the intended message and audience. Data visualisation requires both technical skills and creative thinking to design and implement effective solutions that can meet the needs and expectations of the users.

Learn more about JavaScript algorithms and data structures

Are the building blocks of programming in JavaScript. Algorithms are a set of instructions that define how to perform a specific task, such as sorting an array, finding the shortest path in a graph, or solving a dynamic programming problem.

|**Data structures** |**A Binary Tree**|
|---|---|
|are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer, such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs. Data structures and algorithms are closely related, as different data structures may have different advantages and disadvantages for certain algorithms| can be used to implement a fast sorting algorithm, while a hash table can be used to implement a fast lookup algorithm. Learning JavaScript algorithms and data structures can help you write more efficient and elegant code, as well as prepare you for technical interviews|

> ## [**Responsive Web Design**][responsive-web-design-certificate]

Responsive Web Design is a way of creating websites that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, tablets, and phones

It uses HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge the web page elements to make them look good on any device
Responsive web design also ensures good usability and accessibility for the users

Some of the CSS features that are used for responsive web design are media queries which allow the adaptation of styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as screen width, height, or device orientation
|Fluid Grids:|Fluid Images:|Modern Layout Methods:|
|--|--|--|
|Responsive designs use fluid grids that adjust proportionally to the screen size, ensuring a consistent layout across devices|Images designed to scale within their containing elements, maintaining proper proportions on various devices|Utilize modern layout methods, such as Flexbox and CSS Grid, for more sophisticated and responsive designs|
